    <h3>High Voltage Power System Diagnostics Simulator</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Programming Infrastructure:</strong> Python (NumPy, Pandas)</p>
      <p><strong>Core Engineering Domain:</strong> High-Voltage Transmission Analysis & Diagnostic Modeling</p>

      <p>
        I engineered a high-performance simulation engine designed to automate the modeling of complex, high-voltage electrical grids[cite: 3, 5]. By translating fundamental electrical laws into a modular Python framework, I developed a tool capable of performing full Newton-Raphson power flow solutions and sub-transient sequence modeling for fault diagnostics[cite: 124, 129]. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for calculating grid stability, determining voltage profiles, and evaluating system responses to electrical contingencies[cite: 6, 9].

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>1. Mathematical Engine & Numerical Solvers</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The core of the simulator is an analytical suite that handles the non-linear complexities of power system equations through advanced numerical methods[cite: 110]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Newton-Raphson Implementation:</strong> I programmed a robust iterative solver that handles the relationship between power injections and nodal voltages[cite: 124]. The process continues until the power mismatch falls within a specified precision tolerance (e.g., 1e-4 pu), ensuring a high-accuracy steady-state solution[cite: 124].</li>
      <li><strong>Jacobian Matrix Construction:</strong> The software dynamically assembles the Jacobian matrix by calculating partial derivatives across four distinct quadrants (J1, J2, J3, and J4)[cite: 119, 120]. This allows for the precise linearization of the system equations during each iteration[cite: 121].</li>
      <li><strong>Power Mismatch Validation:</strong> To guarantee physical accuracy, the engine performs real-time mismatch calculations for real (P) and reactive (Q) power at every bus, ensuring that the final solution aligns with the specified boundary conditions of the network[cite: 122].</li>
      <li><strong>Sequence Fault Diagnostics:</strong> The simulator performs diagnostics for positive and negative sequence networks[cite: 125, 127]. It calculates fault current magnitudes and post-fault bus voltages, which are essential for protection coordination and equipment sizing[cite: 128, 129].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>2. Object-Oriented Grid Architecture</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The software architecture is strictly modular, utilizing custom classes to encapsulate the physical and electrical attributes of grid components[cite: 8, 10]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network Nodes (Bus Class):</strong> Serves as the primary node object, identifying bus types—Slack, PV (Generator), or PQ (Load)—while tracking voltage magnitudes and phase angles[cite: 68, 71, 74].</li>
      <li><strong>TransmissionLine & LineCode:</strong> These modules calculate line impedance ($Z$) and shunt admittance ($Y$) by integrating physical parameters like Geometric Mean Radius (GMR), conductor resistance, and line length[cite: 21, 27, 29, 36, 42].</li>
      <li><strong>LineGeometry Module:</strong> This specialized class calculates Geometric Mean Distance (GMD) by processing the spatial x-y coordinates of conductors and bundle spacing, which is critical for accurate inductive and capacitive modeling[cite: 12, 13, 17, 20].</li>
      <li><strong>Transformer (XFMR) Modeling:</strong> Handles the transition between high and low voltage sides, incorporating percentage impedance and X/R ratios to ensure the transformer is correctly represented in the system's primitive admittance matrix[cite: 50, 53, 59, 61, 64].</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>3. Advanced Matrix Operations & Normalization</h4>
    </div>
    <p>To manage the scale of multi-bus networks, the simulator automates critical high-level matrix algebra and system normalization[cite: 9]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated Y-Bus Matrix Construction:</strong> The tool programmatically builds the system-wide Admittance Matrix (Y-Bus) by aggregating primitive admittance data from every individual line and transformer in the circuit[cite: 115, 116].</li>
      <li><strong>Z-Bus Inversion for Fault Analysis:</strong> For sub-transient diagnostics, the engine inverts the faulted Y-Bus matrix to generate the Z-Bus[cite: 128]. This is used to determine how an electrical disturbance at one node impacts the entire grid voltage profile[cite: 129].</li>
      <li><strong>Per-Unit (PU) Normalization Engine:</strong> The software automatically converts all physical measurements (ohms, volts, amperes) into a common per-unit system based on user-defined MVA and Voltage bases, allowing for seamless analysis across different voltage levels[cite: 47, 65].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>4. Engineering Results & Performance Reporting</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      By integrating the <strong>Pandas</strong> library, the simulator provides professional-grade technical reporting[cite: 99]. The output includes polar-form admittance matrices, Jacobian snapshots, and detailed fault reports[cite: 115, 127]. This framework allows engineers to immediately identify potential ampacity violations or excessive power losses, providing the data necessary for critical infrastructure decisions[cite: 124].
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>5. Engineering Considerations & Validation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      As a diagnostic tool, accuracy is paramount. Users are encouraged to verify input data integrity and consistency to ensure modeling results accurately reflect the intended network[cite: 134, 139]. While current performance is optimized for sub-transient and steady-state analysis, future enhancements include zero-sequence modeling for asymmetrical faults and sparse matrix optimization for networks exceeding 100+ buses[cite: 133, 135].
