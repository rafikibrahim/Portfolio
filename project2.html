    <h3>High Voltage Power System Diagnostics Simulator</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Programming Infrastructure:</strong> Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)</p>
      <p><strong>Simulation Tools:</strong> PowerWorld Simulator integration for validation</p>
      <p><strong>Engineering Focus:</strong> Large-Scale Grid Diagnostics, Newton-Raphson Solvers, and Sub-transient Fault Analysis</p>

      <p>
        I engineered a high-fidelity power system simulation engine designed to automate the modeling of complex transmission networks. This tool facilitates in-depth diagnostics by implementing the Newton-Raphson numerical method for power flow and sub-transient sequence modeling for fault analysis. To ensure industrial accuracy, I validated the custom Python algorithms against <strong>PowerWorld Simulator</strong>, achieving consistent results for voltage profiles and line flow transients.

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>1. Object-Oriented Grid Architecture</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The software is built on a strictly modular library of custom classes that encapsulate the physical and electrical attributes of grid components[cite: 3, 8]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network Nodes (Bus Class):</strong> Serves as the primary node object, managing voltage magnitudes and phase angles while classifying nodes as Slack, PV (Generator), or PQ (Load) buses[cite: 71, 74, 91].</li>
      <li><strong>TransmissionLine & LineCode:</strong> These modules calculate line impedance ($Z$) and shunt admittance ($Y$) by integrating physical parameters like Geometric Mean Radius (GMR), conductor resistance (e.g., "Partridge"), and line length[cite: 26, 27, 30, 42].</li>
      <li><strong>LineGeometry Module:</strong> This specialized class calculates Geometric Mean Distance (GMD) by processing the spatial coordinates and bundle spacing of conductors, which is critical for accurate inductive and capacitive modeling[cite: 13, 16, 17].</li>
      <li><strong>Transformer (XFMR) Modeling:</strong> Handles high-to-low voltage transitions, percentage impedance, and $X/R$ ratios, ensuring the transformer is correctly represented in the system Admittance Matrix[cite: 53, 59, 61, 64].</li>
    </ul>

    
    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>2. Computational Engine & Numerical Solvers</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The core of the simulator is an analytical suite that translates physical grid laws into complex numerical algorithms[cite: 110, 112]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Newton-Raphson Power Flow Solver:</strong> I implemented a full-scale iterative solver that handles the non-linear relationship between power injections and voltage. The solver iterates until it meets a user-defined tolerance (e.g., $1e-4$ pu), ensuring high-precision results for grid state variables.</li>
      <li><strong>Jacobian Matrix Assembly:</strong> The engine dynamically assembles the Jacobian matrix from four distinct quadrants ($J_1, J_2, J_3, J_4$), allowing for the linearization of the power flow problem at each iteration.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Mismatch Validation:</strong> To ensure physical accuracy, the software performs real-time mismatch calculations for real ($P$) and reactive ($Q$) power, flagging any deviations from the specified boundary conditions[cite: 122].</li>
    </ul>

    
    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>3. Sub-transient Fault Diagnostics</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The engine facilitates advanced contingency studies through specialized sequence network analysis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sequence Matrix Formulation:</strong> I developed routines to construct sequence-specific Y-Bus matrices, adjusting admittances for faulted conditions in positive and negative sequence networks[cite: 125].</li>
      <li><strong>Z-Bus Matrix Inversion:</strong> For fault analysis, the engine inverts the faulted Y-Bus matrix to obtain the Z-Bus. This allows the determination of exactly how an electrical disturbance at a specific bus impacts the entire grid's voltage profile[cite: 129].</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Fault Calculations:</strong> The engine calculates fault current magnitudes and post-fault bus voltages, which are essential for protection coordination and breaker sizing.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>4. PowerWorld Validation & Industrial Benchmarking</h4>
    </div>
    <p>To confirm the reliability of the Python-based diagnostics, I integrated <strong>PowerWorld Simulator</strong> as a benchmark:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Transients:</strong> Simulated grid faults in PowerWorld to compare sub-transient current injections against the Python engine's Z-bus output.</li>
      <li><strong>Load Flow Benchmarking:</strong> Verified that the Newton-Raphson convergence in Python matched the standard industrial results for multi-bus systems (e.g., IEEE 7-bus and 30-bus test cases).</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Reporting:</strong> Used PowerWorld's visualization tools to generate line flow maps and voltage heatmaps based on the data calculated by my custom algorithms.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>5. Professional Data Processing & Results</h4>
    </div>
    <p>By leveraging the <strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong> libraries, the simulator provides professional-grade technical reporting[cite: 99, 104]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tabular Analysis:</strong> Generates polar-form admittance matrices, Jacobian snapshots, and detailed fault current reports for easy interpretation by engineering teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Per-Unit (PU) Normalization:</strong> The software automatically converts physical ohms, volts, and amperes into a common per-unit system based on user-defined MVA and Voltage bases[cite: 37, 47, 62].</li>
      <li><strong>Operational Warnings:</strong> Includes automated checks for line ampacity violations and excessive system power losses.</li>
    </ul>
