    <h3>RFID-Based Smart Car Gate Opener</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> ATmega328P Standalone Microcontroller</p>
      <p><strong>Engineering Focus:</strong> Embedded Systems, Custom PCB Fabrication, and Security Automation</p>

      <p>
        Inspired by the gate systems at the Soldiers and Sailors Garage, I designed and built an automated vehicle access control prototype. [cite_start]This system operates by prompting users to scan their ID cards through an LCD interface. [cite: 4, 5, 16]

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>1. Design & Functional Overview</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The system provides a seamless, secure entry process through several integrated stages:</p>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Users scan an ID card via an RFID sensor to verify authorized access. [cite: 21, 26]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Interactive Interface:</strong> A 16x2 LCD provides real-time prompts, such as "Scan your ID," "Access Granted," or "Access Denied." [cite: 20, 24, 99]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Physical Actuation:</strong> Upon valid authentication, a servo motor opens the gate arm. [cite: 6, 25, 98]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Intelligent Closure:</strong> An ultrasonic sensor detects vehicles at the gate, enabling automatic closure once the vehicle passes through. [cite: 8, 27, 104]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Audio-Visual Feedback:</strong> A speaker plays distinct tones to indicate access approval or denial, while LEDs visually reinforce these responses (green for granted, red for denied). [cite: 7, 31, 32, 103]</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>2. Technical Implementation & PCB Design</h4>
    </div>
    [cite_start]<p>The project moved from a breadboard prototype to a streamlined custom PCB designed in Altium Designer: [cite: 165, 168]</p>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Power Regulation:</strong> To manage dual voltage requirements, I integrated an LM2937ET-3.3 (for 3.3V RFID requirements) and an LM7805CV (for 5V components) directly onto the PCB. [cite: 110, 159, 169]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Microcontroller Architecture:</strong> I configured a standalone ATmega328P chip, including an AVR programming header for future firmware maintenance. [cite: 55, 173]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Hardware Reliability:</strong> Voltage drops during simultaneous operation were addressed by the strategic placement of capacitors to ensure stable power delivery. [cite: 46, 47, 169]</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>3. Challenges & Engineering Solutions</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Debugging Without Serial:</strong> Since the prototype used a standalone chip, I lacked a standard serial monitor. [cite_start]I utilized the LCD screen as a substitute to display important debugging messages and test outputs. [cite: 66, 67, 68]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Mechanical Engineering:</strong> I modeled a custom enclosure in SolidWorks and constructed the final version from wood to house all components securely and improve aesthetics. [cite: 10, 106, 199, 203]</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Firmware Integration:</strong> Coordinating the timing between the servo motor, RFID authentication, and ultrasonic detection required precise optimization to ensure reliable operation. [cite: 48, 49, 148]</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>4. Project Summary</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      [cite_start]The final prototype successfully replicates real-world parking functionality, demonstrating effective integration of sensors, dual-voltage power regulation, and custom hardware design. [cite: 91, 216, 222, 226]
