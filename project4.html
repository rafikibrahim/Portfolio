    <h3>RFID-Based Smart Car Gate Opener</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> ATmega328P (Standalone Microcontroller)</p>
      <p><strong>Engineering Focus:</strong> Embedded Systems, Custom PCB Design, and Security Automation</p>

      <p>
        Inspired by the gate systems at the Soldiers and Sailors Garage, I designed and built an automated vehicle access control prototype. This system utilizes RFID technology for secure authentication, integrated with real-time user feedback and automated physical actuation.

      <h4>1. Design & Functional Overview</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The system provides a seamless, secure entry process through several integrated stages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Users scan an ID card via the RFID sensor. The system is programmed to accept only specific UIDs (Unique Identifiers) to ensure authorized access only.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive Interface:</strong> A 16x2 LCD provides real-time prompts, such as "Scan your ID," "Access Granted," or "Access Denied."</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Actuation:</strong> Upon valid authentication, a servo motor opens the gate arm to 180 degrees.</li>
      <li><strong>Intelligent Closure:</strong> An ultrasonic sensor detects the vehicle at the gate. The system is programmed to close the gate automatically only after the vehicle has passed through, ensuring safety and efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio-Visual Feedback:</strong> A speaker provides tones for success or denial, complemented by a Green LED for granted access and a Red LED for denied access.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>2. Technical Implementation & PCB Design</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The project moved from a complex breadboard prototype to a streamlined custom PCB designed in Altium Designer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Regulation:</strong> A primary challenge was managing dual voltage requirements: 3.3V for the RFID sensor and 5V for the LCD and servo. I integrated an LM2937ET-3.3 and an LM7805CV regulator directly onto the PCB to provide stable power from a 9V source.</li>
      <li><strong>Microcontroller Architecture:</strong> I configured a standalone ATmega328P chip on the PCB, including an AVR programming header to allow for future firmware updates without removing the chip.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Reliability:</strong> Voltage drops during simultaneous servo and RFID operation were stabilized through the strategic placement of decoupling capacitors.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>3. Challenges & Engineering Solutions</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Debugging Without Serial:</strong> Since the prototype used a standalone chip, I lacked a standard USB serial monitor. I solved this by using the LCD screen as a substitute for the serial monitor to display debugging messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Engineering:</strong> The final enclosure was modeled in SolidWorks and constructed from wood to house all components securely while maintaining an organized internal wire structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Firmware Integration:</strong> Coordinating the timing of the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor required precise coding to ensure the gate didn't close prematurely on the vehicle.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>4. Project Summary</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The final prototype successfully replicates real-world parking access functionality. It demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating sensors, dual-voltage power regulation, and custom hardware design into a robust, practical access control solution.
