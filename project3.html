    <h3>Retro Multiplayer Game Console - Capstone Senior Design Project</h3>

    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Client:</strong> ECE 1896: Senior Design Project</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA</p>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>

      <p>This project involved creating a **dual-screen multiplayer game console** with advanced functionalities, utilizing **embedded systems** and custom **hardware design**. The system runs **classic games** like **Tetris**, **Pong**, and **Minesweeper**, interfacing through **Bluetooth controllers** and delivering high-quality video via **VGA output** to two independent screens. As the **Electrical Engineer**, I led the design, implementation, and integration of **PCBs**, **power systems**, and **communication protocols**, all while adhering to rigorous engineering constraints and testing standards.</p>

      <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> You can view the complete project details, including code, schematics, and documentation, on my <a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/Multiplayer-Retro-Game-Console" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

      <h4>Design Constraints & Challenges</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Before finalizing the design of the system, we conducted rigorous user testing and prototyping to address the key **design constraints**. Some of the main challenges encountered during development include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Management:</strong> The system needed to ensure **72 hours** of continuous gameplay without recharging. This was achieved by utilizing **Li-ion batteries** and **DC-DC step-up converters**, carefully calculating the energy consumption for each component to avoid power failure during extended use.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-Latency Bluetooth Communication:</strong> The game required **real-time wireless communication** between the controllers and the console. Achieving low-latency Bluetooth communication while maintaining reliable data transmission was crucial, and optimizations were made to minimize input lag.</li>
      <li><strong>VGA Output Synchronization:</strong> Generating stable **VGA signals** with proper synchronization for **dual-screen output** was a critical challenge. The system used **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** on the **ESP32 microcontroller** to ensure smooth rendering of high-resolution video.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Integration:</strong> Integrating various subsystems, such as game logic, controller inputs, and video output, required careful planning and signal routing. The PCB design process had to balance complexity with efficiency to keep the system compact and functional.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>System Overview & Design Features</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The system architecture was carefully designed to ensure smooth interaction between hardware components. Key features of the system include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ESP32 Microcontrollers:</strong> At the heart of the console are two **ESP32 microcontrollers** that manage the game logic, video output, and communication between the controllers and the main console.</li>
      <li><strong>Bluetooth Communication:</strong> The controllers communicate wirelessly with the console using **HC-05 Bluetooth modules**, ensuring a **low-latency connection** between the player inputs and game state updates.</li>
      <li><strong>VGA Output:</strong> The **ESP32** generates **VGA video signals** to drive the two independent screens. **DMA techniques** are used to manage the large amount of data required for smooth video rendering.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Controller Design:</strong> The **controller PCB** integrates an **ATmega328P microcontroller** to process input from the joystick and buttons, communicating with the console over Bluetooth. It is powered by a **Li-ion rechargeable battery** and designed for ergonomic comfort.</li>
    </ul>
