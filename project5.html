    <h3>Bark It!: Interactive Cognitive Trainer</h3>

    <div class="project-description">
      [cite_start]<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Junior Design Project [cite: 86]</p>
      [cite_start]<p><strong>Core Objective:</strong> To engineer an interactive, sensor-driven game that provides mental and physical stimulation for dogs by mimicking natural behaviors[cite: 2].</p>
      
      <p>
        [cite_start]"Bark It!" is a sophisticated embedded system that tracks a dog's performance in real-time[cite: 6]. 
        [cite_start]The game randomly selects commands and implements an adaptive difficulty algorithm that reduces the time allowed for tasks as the score increases[cite: 45, 50]. 
        [cite_start]With a high-score target of 99 points, the system encourages repetitive cognitive engagement[cite: 54].

      <h4>Interaction Modes & Gameplay Logic</h4>
    </div>
    [cite_start]<p>The system features three primary hardware-integrated commands[cite: 3, 5]:</p>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Tug It:</strong> Utilizes a joystick sensor to detect directional movement when a dog pulls an attached rope beyond a calibrated threshold[cite: 9, 46].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Dig It:</strong> Employs a large, bright red push button that requires three sequential presses to simulate natural digging behavior[cite: 4, 11, 47].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Place It:</strong> A multi-stage cognitive task where the dog must remove a ball from one compartment (deactivating a limit switch) and place it into another (activating a second switch)[cite: 5, 48].</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Engineering Challenges & Iterative Solutions</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Sequence Logic Refinement:</strong> During prototyping, the "Place It" logic was flawed[cite: 64]. [cite_start]I revised the code to monitor specific state changes—requiring the first limit switch to move from active to inactive before the second switch became active—ensuring the correct sequence of actions was followed[cite: 69, 70].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Continuous Input Monitoring:</strong> To increase realism, the software was updated to check for incorrect actions at all times[cite: 337]. [cite_start]If a dog triggers a sensor not associated with the current command (e.g., pulling the rope during a "Dig It" task), the game ends immediately[cite: 338, 340].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Hardware Reliability:</strong> Replaced initial plans for ultrasonic sensors with limit switches for the "Place It" task, as physical interaction significantly reduced false positives and simplified the logic[cite: 14, 16, 17].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>PCB Aesthetics & Assembly:</strong> Iterated the PCB design to group connectors based on their physical location in the enclosure[cite: 94, 148]. [cite_start]Using 2-pin connectors instead of direct soldering improved wire management and overall product aesthetics[cite: 88, 90, 150].</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Technical Specifications</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> ATMega32[cite: 31].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Joystick, Large Red Push Button, and Dual Limit Switches[cite: 59, 60].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>PCB Design:</strong> 2-Layer custom layout featuring clear labeling and a keep-out layer to prevent external interference[cite: 97, 98, 99].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>User Interface:</strong> 16x2 LCD for real-time score tracking, command display, and system debugging[cite: 6, 49, 76].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Feedback System:</strong> Piezo-audio module providing distinct tones for each command and success/failure melodies[cite: 62, 197, 238, 239].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Structural Design:</strong> Laser-cut wooden doghouse enclosure designed in SolidWorks, featuring a hollow base to conceal the PCB and organize internal wiring[cite: 293, 294, 295, 302].</li>
    </ul>
