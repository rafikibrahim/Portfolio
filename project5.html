    <h3>Bark It!: Interactive Cognitive Trainer</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Client:</strong> Junior Design Project</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA</p>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>

      <p>
        Bark It! is an automated, sensor-driven system designed to provide physical and mental enrichment for canines. 
        By utilizing an <strong>ATMega32 microcontroller</strong>, the device facilitates a real-time gaming loop that tracks performance and scales difficulty based on the user's success rate.
      </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Design Constraints & Objectives</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The development of the trainer was guided by specific functional requirements to ensure accessibility for the animal and reliability for the owner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Behavioral Interfacing:</strong> Tactile sensors, such as joysticks and large push buttons, were selected to accommodate natural canine movements including tugging and paw-pressing.</li>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Feedback:</strong> The system incorporates multimodal cues, using a 16x2 LCD for visual tracking and an audio module for distinct command tones.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety-First Architecture:</strong> All electronic components and wiring are isolated within a hollow base underneath the enclosure to prevent accidental damage during play.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Timing:</strong> The firmware features a dynamic timing variable that reduces the task completion window as the score increases, maintaining high engagement levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>System Architecture</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The system randomly cycles through three primary behavioral commands, each requiring a unique sensor interaction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tug It (Joystick Logic):</strong> Detects directional tension when a rope is pulled beyond a calibrated voltage threshold.</li>
      <li><strong>Dig It (Tactile Input):</strong> Monitors a high-visibility red push button for a sequence of three rapid presses to simulate digging behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Place It (State-Machine Logic):</strong> Monitors the displacement of a ball between two compartments using dual limit switches.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Electronic Design Implementation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      I designed a <strong>2-layer PCB</strong> optimized for modularity within the enclosure. 
      To streamline assembly, I implemented <strong>2-pin connectors</strong> for all I/O instead of direct soldering. 
      This design choice allowed for organized wire routing from the central board to sensors distributed throughout the doghouse structure. 
      The layout includes a keep-out layer to ensure signal integrity and strategic grouping of connectors to minimize interior clutter.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Software Validation & Control Logic</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The firmware manages random task generation and continuous sensor polling. 
      A critical engineering challenge involved the "Place It" command logic. 
      The code was refined to monitor specific state changes: the first switch must move from active to inactive (ball removed) before the second switch moves from inactive to active (ball placed). 
      Furthermore, the system performs continuous monitoring; any incorrect action outside of the active command triggers an immediate game-over state.
    </p>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Mechanical Fabrication</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The enclosure was modeled in <strong>SolidWorks</strong> and constructed from <strong>laser-cut 1/8 inch plywood</strong>. 
      The structure uses sliding joints reinforced with wood glue for high durability. 
      To ensure sensor reliability, I fabricated custom wooden mounts to position the limit switches at the precise height and angle required for ball activation. 
      The final assembly features a "porch" for paw-based tasks and a "storage" area for cognitive object movement.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Design Iterations & Future Work</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      During development, it was determined that ultrasonic sensors were prone to false positives, leading to a pivot to physical limit switches for superior accuracy. 
      Future iterations will focus on integrating <strong>voice-recorded commands</strong> to replace simple tones and <strong>non-volatile memory</strong> to allow high scores to persist after power-cycling.
