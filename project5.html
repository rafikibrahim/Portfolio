    <h3>Bark It!: Interactive Cognitive Trainer</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      [cite_start]<p><strong>Client:</strong> Junior Design Project [cite: 86]</p>
      [cite_start]<p><strong>Location:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA [cite: 299]</p>
      [cite_start]<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025 [cite: 435]</p>

      <p>
        [cite_start]Bark It! is an embedded gaming system engineered to provide physical and mental engagement for dogs[cite: 2]. 
        [cite_start]By integrating a variety of sensors with an ATMega32 microcontroller, the device mimics natural canine behaviors through a responsive, real-time gaming loop[cite: 3, 31, 154].
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-details-section">
      <h4>Before You Keep Reading</h4>
      <p>
        [cite_start]The primary design inspiration and "user-testing" muse for this project was Rio, a medium-sized dog[cite: 39, 40]. 
        [cite_start]Every mechanical constraint, from the enclosure height to sensor placement, was calibrated to suit canine ergonomics[cite: 40, 298, 300].
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Foundational Design Constraints</h4>
    </div>
    [cite_start]<p>Through systematic prototyping and testing, the following core engineering requirements were established[cite: 58, 59, 82]:</p>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Behavioral Interfacing:</strong> Standard UI elements were replaced with hardware that supports tugging, digging, and object displacement[cite: 3, 4, 5, 288].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Cognitive Feedback:</strong> The system must provide distinct aural and visual cues to signify task transitions, success, or failure[cite: 6, 61, 62].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Owner/User Safety:</strong> The electronics are isolated in a hollow base to prevent accidental interaction with internal high-current paths or delicate circuitry[cite: 295, 307].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Dynamic Scaling:</strong> To prevent boredom, the system implements an adaptive timing logic that decreases the reaction window as the dog's score increases[cite: 50, 199].</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Logical System Architecture</h4>
    </div>
    [cite_start]<p>The system is built upon an ATMega32 microcontroller which orchestrates the following three sensor branches[cite: 31, 156]:</p>
    <ul>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Tug It (Joystick):</strong> Detects directional tension when a rope is pulled beyond a predefined voltage threshold[cite: 9, 46].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Dig It (Industrial Button):</strong> Monitors a large red push button for a sequence of three rapid presses[cite: 11, 47].</li>
      [cite_start]<li><strong>Place It (Limit Switches):</strong> Uses dual limit switches to verify a ball has been moved from one designated compartment to another in a specific order[cite: 48, 69, 70].</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Electronic Implementation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      [cite_start]I designed a 2-layer PCB focused on modularity and signal integrity[cite: 85, 98]. 
      [cite_start]Rather than direct-soldering components, the board utilizes 2-pin connectors for all I/O[cite: 88]. 
      [cite_start]This allows the microcontroller to sit in the protected base while communicating with sensors distributed throughout the larger enclosure[cite: 89, 90, 295]. 
      [cite_start]The layout includes a keep-out layer and strategic grouping of connectors to minimize cross-talk and simplify assembly[cite: 94, 99, 148].
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Software Design & Validation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      [cite_start]The firmware is written in C++ and uses a polling-based state machine[cite: 154, 203, 204]. 
      [cite_start]A significant challenge arose with the "Place It" sequence[cite: 64]. 
      [cite_start]The initial code failed to distinguish between a ball being moved or simply picked up and put back down[cite: 65, 332, 341]. 
      [cite_start]The final logic verifies that the ball is removed (Switch 1: Active to Inactive) and subsequently placed in the target hole (Switch 2: Inactive to Active)[cite: 69, 70]. 
      [cite_start]Additionally, the software provides continuous monitoring; any incorrect sensor trigger outside of the current active command leads to an immediate game-over state[cite: 200, 337, 338].
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Mechanical Fabrication</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      [cite_start]The "Doghouse" enclosure was modeled in SolidWorks and manufactured from laser-cut 1/8 inch plywood[cite: 286, 293, 294]. 
      [cite_start]Structural integrity was achieved through sliding-joint panels reinforced with wood glue[cite: 303, 304]. 
      [cite_start]Internal limit switches were mounted on custom-fabricated wooden cubes to ensure they sat at the precise height for reliable activation by a tennis ball[cite: 324, 325].
    </p>

    <div class="tech-details-section">
      <h4>Retrospective and Future Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        The Mk. [cite_start]I prototype highlighted the importance of robust sensor selection; switching from ultrasonic sensors to limit switches drastically improved reliability by requiring physical interaction[cite: 14, 16, 17]. 
        [cite_start]Future versions will incorporate non-volatile memory for high-score retention and integrated voice commands to improve accessibility for the animals[cite: 54, 467, 468, 469].
