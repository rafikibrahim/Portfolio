    <h3>Bark It!: Interactive Cognitive Trainer</h3>
    
    <div class="project-description">
      <p><strong>Client:</strong> Junior Design Project</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA</p>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>

      <p>
        Bark It! is an interactive, sensor-driven game console engineered to provide both mental and physical stimulation for dogs. 
        The system utilizes an <strong>ATMega32 microcontroller</strong> to monitor behavioral inputs and deliver real-time feedback through a dynamic, scoring-based gaming loop.

      <h4>Before You Keep Reading</h4>
      <p>
        The primary design inspiration for this project was "Rio," a medium-sized dog. 
        All mechanical constraints, from the doghouse height to the activation force of the sensors, were calibrated specifically to accommodate canine ergonomics and natural movements.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Foundational Design Constraints</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Through iterative testing with a breadboard prototype and physical mockups, the following engineering requirements were established:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Behavioral Interfacing:</strong> Standard touchscreens were bypassed for tactile inputs like ropes and buttons that can be manipulated by paws or mouths.</li>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Feedback:</strong> The system provides multimodal cues—including distinct audio tones and visual LCD prompts—to signify command transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & Isolation:</strong> The electronics are housed in a hollow base to isolate delicate circuitry and wiring from physical interaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Difficulty:</strong> The firmware implements a dynamic timing variable that reduces the task window as the score increases to maintain high user engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>System Architecture</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The system is organized into three primary behavioral sensor branches controlled by the central MCU:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tug It (Joystick Branch):</strong> Detects directional tension when a rope is pulled beyond a calibrated voltage threshold.</li>
      <li><strong>Dig It (Tactile Branch):</strong> Monitors a large red button for a specific sequence of three rapid presses.</li>
      <li><strong>Place It (Logic Branch):</strong> Monitors a ball being moved from one compartment to another using dual limit switches.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Electronic Design Implementation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      I designed a <strong>2-layer PCB</strong> optimized for modularity within a custom enclosure. 
      To improve assembly and aesthetics, I utilized <strong>2-pin connectors</strong> for all I/O instead of direct soldering. 
      This allowed us to use extension wires to connect the central board to sensors placed in the "porch" and "storage" areas of the enclosure. 
      The layout includes strategic grouping of connectors and a keep-out layer to ensure signal integrity during operation.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Software Design & Validation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The firmware is written in C++ and handles random task selection, input validation, and scoring. 
      A significant challenge arose with the <strong>Place It</strong> sequence logic. 
      The code was revised to monitor specific state changes—requiring Switch 1 to move from active to inactive (ball removed) and Switch 2 to move from inactive to active (ball placed) in a specific order. 
      Additionally, the system performs continuous input monitoring; any incorrect action triggers an immediate game-over state to ensure a realistic challenge.
    </p>

    

    <div class="section-title">
      <h4>Mechanical Fabrication</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The enclosure was modeled in <strong>SolidWorks</strong> as a doghouse and manufactured from laser-cut 1/8 inch plywood. 
      Structural integrity was achieved through sliding joints reinforced with wood glue. 
      To solve mounting issues, custom-fabricated wooden cubes were used to position the limit switches at the precise height and angle for reliable ball activation. 
      Internal wires were wrapped in black tape to maintain a professional, organized appearance.
    </p>

    <div class="tech-details-section">
      <h4>Mistakes and Future Steps</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Iterative Learning:</strong> During prototyping, we discovered that ultrasonic sensors were unreliable for detecting ball placement; we pivoted to limit switches to reduce false positives. 
        Additionally, we learned to favor wood glue over hot glue for cleaner, more durable vertical joints.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Next Steps:</strong> Future iterations will incorporate <strong>voice commands</strong> (replacing tones with recorded speech like "Dig It!") and <strong>non-volatile memory</strong> to store session high scores permanently.
